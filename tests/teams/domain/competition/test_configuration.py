#  create the competition
#  create the groups
#  create the teams
#  create the rankings
#  create the sub competions
#     create the series or records
#  create the games for the first sub competitions
#  schedule the games
#  everytime a playoff game is done, check if you need to schedule for for that series
#  everytime a playoff series is done, check if the round is done, if it's done, go to the next round
#  a playoff series sub competition can be done in order, and from groups create by previous rounds
#  so if you want a playoff round to run at the same time as a table, but the second round is after, it's another sub competition
#  all sub competitions must be done before we can go onto the next order of sub comps
#  all sub comps should be created at the same time but not setup until their order comes up so that we can rely on groups populated by previouis comps
